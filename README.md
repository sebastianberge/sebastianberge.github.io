## About

This web application is designed to showcase a portfolio of my self, my CV and projects I've worked on. I've also added a blog for posting small posts now and then.

To avoid using any database for hosting the blog posts (and avoid coding them in the application code), I've just created a blog-post repository on GitHub. The blog posts are then just fetched directly from there instead of fetching from any database.
